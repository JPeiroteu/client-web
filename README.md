### Motivation and background
Our vision is to enable enjoyable remote chess games for both parties.

Due to the high amount of requests to explain the project, we decided to create a landing page, which also acts as the hub to use our services. This website informs people of interest, e.g. the CODE community, the MotionLab community, about the services and technological functionality of this project. 
Simultaniously, visitors can start remote chess games.

The landing page serves as a project to demonstrate general knowledge of web-development, front-end technologies. The development requires a general understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and relational databases, as well as sketching a user friendly website. 

This webpage was created using the Sveltekit framework for increased performance and code quality.

### Developing

1. Install dependencies using `npm i`
2. Start the dev server and open in a new browswer tab using `npm run dev -- --open`
3. Have fun! Take a look at the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) docs and the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

### Building

Preview the production build using `npm run preview`.
Or create a production build: `npm run build`.

### Deploying

Netlify Build continously deploys the app to Netlify, so you don't have to worry about anything.
You can preview deploys by visiting `[branch]--pawnhubchess.netlify.app` or `deploy-preview-[PR#]--pawnhubchess.netlify.app`.
