### Motivation and background
Our vision is to enable enjoyable remote chess games for both parties.

Due to the high amount of requests to explain the project, we decided to create a landing page. This website informs people of interest, e.g. the CODE community, the MotionLab community, about the services, product, technological functionality of this project. 

The landing page serves as a project to demonstrate general knowledge of web-development. The development requires a general understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and relational databases, as well as sketching a user friendly website.

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
